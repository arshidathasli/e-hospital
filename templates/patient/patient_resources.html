            <p class="card-text">Strength training: Incorporate strength training exercises at least twice a week to build muscle, improve bone density, and support overall mobility.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title border-bottom pb-2 mb-4">Eat a Balanced Diet</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Consume whole foods: Focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats like nuts, seeds, and olive oil.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Portion control: Avoid overeating by paying attention to portion sizes and eating mindfully. Stop eating when you're comfortably full, not stuffed.</p>
